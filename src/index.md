## What is Cobalt?

Cobalt is a programming language made in Roblox with luau, his main porpuse was to be the Cobalt-OS language of a Roblox game, and this is a documentation made exclusively to talk about Cobalt, every point to make you do anything. _Have fun coding devs!_

## Getting started

Theres not a specific point to you get started in Cobalt, but you can start exploring in [basics](basics) section.

# Note

I am thinking to bring Cobalt outside of Roblox, but not for now. So, if you want to test the language, you have to play the game in Roblox. _(Don't worry, nothing is paid. Should not be.)_

Cobalt is a experimental language so, bugs and problems should be expected.
