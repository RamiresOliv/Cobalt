## What is Rubber?

Rubber is a programming language made in Roblox with luau, his main porpuse was to be the OS language of a game, this website/documentation was made exclusively for Rubber. _Have fun coding devs!_
Rubber is a experimental language, bugs and problems should be expected.

## Getting started

To you start using Rubber please check the [basics](./basics/) section.

# Note

I am thinking to bring Rubber outside of Roblox, but not for now. So, if you want to test the language, you have to play the game in Roblox. _(Don't worry nothing is paid.)_
