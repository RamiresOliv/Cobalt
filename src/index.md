You can test Cobalt in roblox: [www.roblox.com/games/97398140739060/Cobalt](https://www.roblox.com/games/97398140739060/Cobalt)

# Note

I am thinking to bring Cobalt outside of Roblox, but not for now. So, if you want to test the language, you have to play the game in Roblox. _(Don't worry, nothing is paid. Should not be.)_

Cobalt is a experimental language so, bugs and problems should be expected.

**I will never ask robux or real money for you use Cobalt.**
