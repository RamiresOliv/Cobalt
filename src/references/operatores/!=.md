# Not Equal

This operator is used to compare two values, very usefull in if's.
**This operator is universal.**

## Usage:

```clj
(!= true true) ; false
(!= true "abc") ; true (boolean ins't string)
(!= "abc" "abc") ; false
(!= "abc" "aBc") ; true
(!= 1 "1") ; false
(!= (type 1) "number") ; false
(!= (type "1") "number") ; false (Yes, string and numbers are the same.)
(!= (type (str "1")) "number") ; false
(!= "abc" nil) ; true
```

## In code examples:

```clj
(let input (prompt (str Hey, try don't guess my number:)))
(let number (math-random 1 5))

(if (!= {input} {number})
    (print (str You did it! Good job!))
else
    (print (str Wasn't this time :<))
)
```
