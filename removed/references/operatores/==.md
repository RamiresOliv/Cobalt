# Equal

This operator is used to compare two values, very usefull in if's.
**This operator is universal.**

## Usage:

```clj
(== true true) ; true
(== true "abc") ; false (boolean ins't string)
(== "abc" "abc") ; true
(== "abc" "aBc") ; false
(== 1 "1") ; true
(== (type 1) "number") ; true
(== (type "1") "number") ; true (Yes, string and numbers are the same.)
(== (type (str "1")) "number") ; true
```

## In code examples:

```clj
(let input (prompt (str Hey, guess the number:)))
(let number (math-random 1 5))

(if (== {input} {number})
    (print (str You are right! Good job!))
else
    (print (str Wasn't this time :<))
)
```
